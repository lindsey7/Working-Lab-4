===============
LAB 4: STATISTICS 215A, FALL 2014

The repository for this project may be found at: 
https://github.com/lindsey7/STAT-215A-Lab-4

The repository includes: 
(a) raw Latex .tex file
(b) R code 
(c) a final .pdf file

To reproduce the analysis in the .tex file: 
1) Download the image1.txt, image2.txt, and image3.txt files in the image_data folder, and place the image_data folder
   in a local working directory.
2) Copy this repository into the local working directory with the command: $ git clone 'repository', 
   where 'repository' represents the public repository for this project (provided above). 
3) Open "Lab 4.R", install any packages listed in library() commands prior to running the code. 
4) Run the R code. 
5) Open the .tex file: this file should be saved in the same local working directory, from the $ git clone step. 
6) Once the code runs, the .pdf and .png files should be in your local working directory and the .tex document should 
   compile, as in the .pdf file.
